I heard about the event from some mutual friends. I was really into civic tech which I think is a subset of transit planning. It is really exciting to hear about grass root organizing and transit organization meeting together to talk about big ideas.
The whole day was full of unconferences that made it a dynamic conference set by the people there in the room.</description></item><item><title>How well do you know your Cloud?</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/gcp-architecture/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2018 10:01:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/gcp-architecture/</guid><description>Back in May, I shared on Linkedin that I received my Google Cloud Architect certification. It was probably my most shared post ever on the platform. A week later, I attained the Data Engineer certification and at the beginning of July, the Associate Cloud Engineer. I ventured to guess that I was the first engineer at Cloudreach to get all three. I get a few common questions and I hoped to answer all here:</description></item><item><title>Cheap Haircuts in Manhattan for Now</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/cheap-haircuts-in-manhattan-for-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 05:05:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/cheap-haircuts-in-manhattan-for-now/</guid><description>On an island where dollar* pizza is no longer a dollar and brunch is repacked as breakfast with booze for $$$ it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find value.

INTRO Amazon maintains 9 different certifications and specialties that you become certified in. Most of the certifications are valid for 2 years. Some are pre-requests for others; for example, the Solutions Architect Associate is required before taking the professional but some exams such as the Cloud Practioner have no requisites.</description></item><item><title>Serverless IAM Permissions</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/serverless-iam-permissions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 10:01:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/2018/serverless-iam-permissions/</guid><description>How do we create an IAM (Identity Access Management) user with the bare minimum permissions to access the resources it needs for Serverless?

Did I accomplish what I set out to do? Did I become a better programmer? How would I describe my experience to others?
I&amp;rsquo;ll be direct and say my experience at Recurse was overly positive and I&amp;rsquo;m still in awe that it exists.</description></item><item><title>RC 11: Stanleybot ðŸ¤– 1.Oh.n0</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/ai-chatbots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:07:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/ai-chatbots/</guid><description>During my last week at Recurse, I wanted to apply the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained about Machine Learning into a project. During my batch, I spent a portion of my time immersing myself with the terminology, concepts, and tooling but not as much as I hoped building and applying what I&amp;rsquo;d learned.
On the final week, I wanted to attempt one of the projects on my back burner for a while.</description></item><item><title>RC 10: Preparing for the Software Interview</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/interview-prep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 17:18:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/interview-prep/</guid><description>Software interviewing practices in the US usually involve a combination of the below
Phone Screens Team Pairing Take Home Projects Design and Architecture Interviews Whiteboard Interviews Hopefully, I am not alone in the shared dread of whiteboarding. As developers who type source code, use tools and reference documentation, approaching problems on the whiteboard is far removed from what we&amp;rsquo;re used to.

I was inspired to build something similar to QuickDraw, a thinkwithgoogle.com project, which allowed you to play Pictionary against the machine. I had been studying machine learning during my batch and thought it was an excellent fun project to try and make. I thought about how I could translate the canvas positions to lines but couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a way to generate enough tag data to make it work.</description></item><item><title>RC 8: Alternative to GSuite: Named domains with Zoho</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/ditching-gsuite/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:43:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/ditching-gsuite/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long supporter of Google Services; Practically it&amp;rsquo;s wired into our online identity. And the nature of your Google account, it touches everything now. It builds value when it can aggregate all the parts of your identity across their properties. Just check out your Google MyActivities, they have information on all your interaction with all of Google&amp;rsquo;s services across your devices. The difficulty of sticking with GSuite means splitting your data between different profiles.</description></item><item><title>RC 7: Chrome Productivity Extensions</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/7-code-productivity-chrome-exts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 19:54:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/7-code-productivity-chrome-exts/</guid><description>Extensions are an excellent way to augment a browser user experience to be more useful for the user. However, extensions can also make your browser less performant and even open security issues for your browser. When I install any Chrome Extension I look at their requested permissions and better yet source to make sure they are sensible. Most of these extensions are catered towards software developers and are very practical and familiar for approaching the web.</description></item><item><title>RC 6: Quantified Checkin</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/halfway-checkin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 15:55:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/halfway-checkin/</guid><description>My time at the Recurse Center is halfway over, and the next portion starts this Tuesday on Jan 3rd in the new year after a week hiatus. There will be ~30 new faces joining and only 6 weeks left of the batch left. Two months have flown by and so much has been done it&amp;rsquo;s hard to gather and describe so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to quantify it integers and data form.</description></item><item><title>RC 5: Code &amp;&amp; People</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/more-to-rc-than-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 15:00:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/more-to-rc-than-code/</guid><description>Software is more than code, its includes the people and communities that form around them. Code and humans are irrevocably inseparable (for now&amp;hellip;) and while at the Recurse Center we are focused on writing code, building projects, and exploring new concepts it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ignore the people and the human elements in the mix.
Often when I&amp;rsquo;m asked to describe the Recurse Center, I tend to talk more about the people and ideas being shared instead of the physical space or even projects we work on.</description></item><item><title>RC 4: Debugging debugging</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/debugging-debugging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 22:13:50 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/debugging-debugging/</guid><description>Debugging is easy, the answer is always the the last place you look. Mastery of debugging I would argue is a more valuable skill than programming itself. Often the worst feelings are staring at your code hopelessly trying to understand where the logic is breaking down.
At Recurse, there are lots of ways to tap into help. We have Zulip stream&amp;rsquo;s dedicated to every programming language imaginable, #pairing, #advice, and even just plain #help.</description></item><item><title>RC 3: Applying to the Recurse Center</title><link>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/the-application-process/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 16:50:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stanzheng.com/blog/recurse/the-application-process/</guid><description>Notes from past Recursers on applying to recurse helped me navigate the process and keep my sanity.

Settling In Each week I hope to go deeper and highlight something I&amp;rsquo;m working on at Recurse. Coming into Recurse I aimed to get into a routine and continue it throughout the twelve weeks.

Day one of RC is widely different from every other day. Its more structured and is full of presentations and socializing. This is my personal account from my day one experience, your experience may vary. They are always changing and aiming to improve the first day experience.

This can add some benefits such as being able to have a staging/live server and demo in real time to a sharable remote. However setting up all those tools isn&amp;rsquo;t always fun for small tasks.
