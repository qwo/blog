I heard about the event from some mutual friends. I was really into civic tech which I think is a subset of transit planning. It is really exciting to hear about grass root organizing and transit organization meeting together to talk about big ideas.
The whole day was full of unconferences that made it a dynamic conference set by the people there in the room.</description></item></channel></rss>
