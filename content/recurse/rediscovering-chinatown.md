I was born in Manhathan Chinatown at [Gouverneur_Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouverneur_Health) as a first generation American-Born Chinese (ABC). My parents immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and have worked in chinese restaurants ever since I could remember. On the weekdays I went to school at [Jacob Riss (P.S. 126)](http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/02/M126/default.htm) but on the weekends my sister and I would spend time at the family restaurant in Flatbush, Brooklyn. I and grew up in New York until I moved to Virginia in 2003.

At Recurse I've had the opportunity to improve my programming skills and learn about new technologies. But I've also been able to rediscover much of my cultural identity in NYC . I felt very disconnected growing up in Virginia, at a school system with < 1% of asian students, it was easy to not place importance in chinese cultural traditions. At home, my parents only ever spoke [Fuzhou dialect chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou_dialect). The standard chinese taught in schools was [Mandarin chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) which I'm still practicing at a elementary proficiency.
