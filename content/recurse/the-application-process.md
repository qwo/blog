# ~Active Draft Advisory~
# The content may get refined and elaborated but this is a final rough draft. To get more content out the door, I'm openingly publishing more of my blogs and going back to revise from feedback.

Notes from past Recursers and the blog about applying to the program helped me navigate the process and keep my sanity. [John Hergenroeder's](http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/) was especially insightful so I hope this article can do the same. By the way, if you're reading this you should consider [applying to the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat).

Submit an Application
---
For the [initial application](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat), it asks you a few questions and asks you to submit a succinct code gist that doesn't use frameworks or require too much background knowledge to be understood by a reader.

I didn't have anything on hand, so that saturday I spent the afternoon coding Boggle in Python on the CLI.
I got nervous since I thought maybe it wasn't complex enough or. I was trying to pair down the program
I think spent the rest of the night writing and revising the written application and exhaustinly submitted the following Sunday night. After this you get a confirmation from Recurse that'd you be contacted either way in the next few days. For my program I implemented [Boggle/Ruzzle in python in ~200 LOC](https://gist.github.com/stanzheng/d41bd3cada14c3b6310f33f0793e4ec2).

A few days later ...

If you get called back, each of the subsequent interviews are scheduled through the Recurse site and take at most ~30 minutes. The interview are conducted over screen sharing and VOIP; We used Skype. You talk to two different admission officers; _Recurse Center_ admission officers who are Recurse Alumni themselves. One handles the initial interview, the second handles the code interview. The [Recurse Apply FAQ](https://www.recurse.com/faq) is extremely well detailed and accurate, so I won't duplicate any comments.

With my initial interview, I had it with David B. It was a very casual conversations about why I wanted to do Recurse. The interview is split into two portions, one where the interviewer asks questions and the interviewee asks questions. I felt like we were moving through a million thoughts a minute and very quickly the half hour was up. I left the interview feeling like there was more to be said and was unsure if what I wanted to communicated was conveyed in the conversation. Theres not much preparation you can do for this interview besides making sure you're succient and on topic. Having a few mental points that you want to convey or talk about isn't too bad but the interviewer has read your written application before so try not to regurgitate word for word specific points.

Two days later

I got a email @10PM on monday for a follow up interview. I was super relieved and excited to move on to the next stage of the process. I scheduled a followup with Simon W. to do a thiry minute Wednesday night session. For the second interview they ask you to pair with the interviewer. You can build something else ontop of preexisting code you've written or pick one of the suggested problems. I ended up choosing the same gist of code for the sake of time and building scoring into the program. I was super nervous and the night before relinted my code, added unit tests, and changed development workflows so the interview would go smoother.

We once again did it over Skype, this session was at 9pm at night. You only get 30 minute and they go by *fast*. Although it was just point score, Boggle/Ruzzle has [dynamic bonus word scoring](http://ruzzleonline.net/ruzzle-tips-to-improve-your-ruzzle-score/) based on length and letters so it made it an interesting problem to walk through. I was going to first do simple scoring just based off the length of the words and move into multipliers. I hadn't done pair programming in a traditional sense since one class in college and spent a day [reading pairing techniques](https://www.google.com/search?q=pair+programming+tips).


Although sure enough like the first interview, 30 minutes quickly approached and we were still in the middle of refactoring, a little under half of where I'd expect I'd be at this point of the pairing session. We verbally talked about how we could attack the next portion and the session was over.
I felt confident I was able to eloquate myself clearly and communicate where we were going in the Code. Simon had good feedback and even taught me a factoid about generator comprehensions.

The Wait
---
At this point I was at the end, either I was in or out. This was the most nerve racking part of the process. For four days I was super anxious whether or not I would be packing up my life and moving 300 miles up to NYC. I tried to keep everything off my mind. At this portion I had been going to conferences and code retreats to keep learning and stop stressing. I got the admission notice while I was at [All Things Open](post/all-things-open/). I was extremely relieved and now anxious to know what came next.


How was it?
---
All in all the process was very short. From the time they received my application and my admission it was 9 days. Even less if you discount time spent waiting inbetween interviews. I liken the process to the college application process that was actually very sane and transparent. Everything was communicated, the process was absolutely transparent and nothing was ambiguous. The process left me feeling confident going to Recurse would be a good fit and more excited about the future. I'm at the half way point of my batch and I feel more confident than ever that this was a good choice and I hope it encourages someone to apply and maybe even calm your nerves.

If you want to join the world's best programming community and become a better programmer consider joining the Recurse Center.
