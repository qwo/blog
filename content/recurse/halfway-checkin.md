My batch is halfway over, and the next portion starts on Tuesday, Jan 3rd in the new year after a week hiatus. There will be ~30 new faces joining and only 6 weeks left of the Recurse Center left. Two months have flown by and so much has been done it's hard to gather in describe so it's easier to quantify in some form of integers and data.

I started my batch originally on November 7th and 55 days have elapsed. During normal RC weeks, I get in the morning in the space around ~8-9am in the morning and leave ~11 pm averaging ideally around a 14 hour work day. I use a few tools to track my time and what I did during my batch detailed [here](/week-1/).


In the past two months,

For the next six weeks
---

To solidify this as a new years post, I'll lay out my next 6 weeks in Resolution form:

#### Build a production ready machine learning system
I want to pick back up learning Machine learning and building a small production ready system. I have been going through the [fast.ai by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas](http://www.fast.ai/) which teachers ML from a coder's perspective. Similar to great work done by [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) to make the field more accessible for everyone.
#### Write and delete more lines of code
 Both [Malcom Gladwell](http://wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) and [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) point that practicing your skill is the only way to increase your expertise in your respective way. Although I spent 130 hrs of my time at Recurse zoned in coding, it only made up about 1/4th of my time there. Finding and cycling through project ideas led to just less code being written. I hope to get it closer to 50% and decrease my general downtime. Aiming to narrow down and focus on specific project ideas

#### Work on a midsized-big project and collaborate on it with others
Coming into Recurse I wanted to collaborate more with other programmers on building systems together. The best way to learn more about yourself as a developer is FOILing off of other programmers and making cool stuff together.

#### Get better at writing

Been blogging more as a self-reflective mechanism and share more knowledge. But writing is tough and each entry takes hours to produce. I want to practice timeboxing while keeping up and improving my writing both technical and nontechnical and continue outputting more writing.


Ringing in the new year. Looking optimistically at the next few weeks and onward into 2017!
