My batch is halfway over, and the next portion starts on Tuesday Jan 3rd in the new year after a week hiatus. There will be ~30 new faces joining and only six weeks left of Recurse left. Two months have flown by and so much has been done it's hard to gather in words so its easier to quantify in some form of integers.

I started my batch originally on November 7th and 55 days have elapsed. During normal RC weeks, I get in the morning in the space around ~8-9am in the morning and leave ~11pm averaging ideally around a 14 hour work day. I use a few tools to track my time and what I did during my batch detailed [here](/week-1/).
