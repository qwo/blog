Debugging is easy, the answer is always the last place you look.
Mastery of debugging one could argue is a more valuable skill than programming itself. Often the worst feelings are staring at your code hopelessly trying to understand where the logic is breaking down. Coding projects that well scoped, that you've built 100 time before you're driving through syntax or architecture and technical. But often time's we're in new systems with new APIs programming from a weak position


In RC often in the zulip stream when you reach a point of mental anguish you ask for help. If you're lucky you'll be them . At last places I worked there was always one engineer you had in mind whenever you run into a deep mental block you knew could held bail you out of deep mental despair. My aspiration is to be that engineer that mentally you could rely on to help you in the darkest of holes. To get deep into the nitty gtityy.


Tips for Pair Debugging
---
1. Timebox your sessions.
2. Walkthrough the problem without any bias.
3. It's probably something more obvious than you expect.
4. Cut down the problem by commenting out or deleting unrelated code,
5. Celebrate your successes



Talk less think more.
Stand up comedy funny mental chess.



Stephanie hangman


Be open that you may not know the answer.
Explain and walk through the problem  Stephanie was working on a game with a. 2d chart program and python. All the problems would draw call all the dictionary functions at once. She mentioned if she put it in quotations


Patterns in Python. Sequential command call pattern try an array.



Noah react flask


Don't assume. Red herrings are everywhere . The original question was debugging react. We were trying to drop in on the middle of the code. Feels like we went 15 minutes back and forth trying to drop into this code. Easy enough after if it takes fiveteen minutes take a step back and take a break or reevaluate. Recollect.


Look at the console
Solution looked at the network tab


We were getting an object and we were trying to map over it. We were expecting an array.


Don't ignore the errors.


Take a step back


Jon Python
Time box debugging
If it sounds crazy you're probably crazy. The devil is in the details. Have a plan.


We were on two different setups. Red herrings. Different environments. Running out of room. Not able to load it. Questionable what was happening was working fine on my machine. Dig deeper into differences. Reproducing is key. reproducing solved you found the answer already.


The file was importing itself which caused an issue. Python import paths. Somethings the answer if it's obvious we often jump to extremes. Don't deviate too much.


Denis virtual box
Make sure you're standing under firm ground.
Virtual box assumption it was correct. Make everything the same when possible

Simple enough solved.

Set up a debugging plan
Offer upfront what you know in the beginning
Red herrings.
Sometimes the error messages are wrong.
