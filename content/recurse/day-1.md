**--ACTIVE DRAFT--**
===

Day one of RC is widely different from every other day. Its more structured and is full of presentations and  socializing. This is my personal account from my Day one experience your experience may vary. They are always changing and aiming to improve the first day experience.


Getting here
---
I took the bus up from Norfolk to New York Saturday night. I woke up Monday morning to walk from Chinatown to SoHo to the `455 Broadway space`. On the first day, its recommended you show up at 10:00am. Before I the surrounding parts of Little Italy and Chinatown had some good coffee at [Happy Bones](http://happybonesnyc.com/).


Orientation
---

The space is on a second floor walk up next to Duande Reade and a Muji stationary store. When I got upstairs I was greeted with a beautiful open space buzzing with people. Recurse Center works with [overlapping batches](https://www.recurse.com/blog/36-overlapping-batches), people 6 weeks into their program co-mingle with the new group starting their 12-week batch. The icebreakers and intros dovetailed into lunch where we could sign up to grab a bite to eat in the surrounding area. Recurse is luckily near Chinatown and Little Italy so there are plenty of affordable delicious diverse options to go to. Our group went to Vanessa's Dumplings which I highly recommend.

Workshops and Presentations

We spun out into workshops which were graciously put on by the facilitators and the previous Fall 2 batch of students.


- Build your own programming language by Marcio. [His Presentation later was posted on HN](https://github.com/marciok/Mu)
- Code Dojos led by Miles: Workshop where you solve a small problem, either pairing or solo and share solutions after.
- Machine Learning Overview by Mike, Nathan and Marko:  Gave an overview of the vast field of Machine Learning.

Presentations
---
After a few hours of workshops, there was a schedule of presentations. Traditionally at Recurse on Thursday there are lightning talks that each person has 5 minutes to present. There was a vast diversity of talks from ones on *Teaching games to play Tic Tac Toe*, to *Understanding Unix Tools* and *Building Ray Tracers*. All the presentations were wonderful and hopefully in 6 weeks, our group will be doing the same.

After the presentations, Sonali gave the closing notes. The day was adjourned and for the rest of our twelve weeks we are in charge of our time We all had received keys to space and were introduced to the mechanisms to keep ourselves on track but largely we were in charge of our time. Recurse Center is self-directed, everyone is here for different reasons but we all want each other and ourselves to succeed. RC has facilitators, residents, check-ins-checkouts, and presentations all aimed at helping us reach our goals.

RC is a Community
---
After the presentations, many of us stuck around. We talked and got to know each other more. We made weekend plans, we shared what each other were hoping to work on. We shared our backgrounds and what we hoped to do in the future. We went for pizza at this place called [Joeys's](http://www.joeypepspizza.com/index/Joey_Pepperonis_Pizza___New_York_City.html), they do dollar pizza cheese pizza slices. A group of us came back to the space and played a game called [Contact](http://forum.frontrowcrew.com/discussion/7294/learn-how-to-play-the-word-game-contact) for a few hours.

Recurse is unique. Recurse is an experiment. Recurse is what you make it.
