Settling In 
===
I wrote a separate post detailing my [Day One](/recurse/day-1) experience. Coming into Recurse I aimed to get into a routine and continue it throughout the twelve weeks. I read the community wikipedia and all the accounts online about how I could get the most out of my time. 

I was committed to being reflective and setting up mechanisms to keep myself on track. I joined 33 other Recursers from diverse backgrounds but we all shared the goal of becoming better programmers.

I wanted to share a few of the strategies I've put together to make myself more accountable during my time.


Getting Organized
===
Along with becoming a better programmer, I also made it a secondary goal to become more organized with my ideas. We all have a finite amount of time and effort, and one of the hardest things is which ideas to pursue. 

Putting my ideas down
---
For organizing my ideas I set up a Trello board to kanban my ideas. I started with a few categories to group everything together:

- `Ehh ideas`
- `Ice Box`
- `Ideas`
- `In Progress`
- `Done` 

Each idea starts as a card under the column `Ideas`. When I make the card, I try to write down a description of what inspired the idea and some bullet points to execute it. Often, I put the ideas down and let it sit for a while. Sometimes depending on a whole host of factors, I shift the ideas back to `Ice Box` or `Ehh Ideas`. If I feel like I'm not going to work on it in the immediate future I shift it to `Ice Box`. If I fall out of love with the idea, I shift it down to `Ehh Ideas`. 

When I start on one of the ideas, I shift it over to `In Progress`. While working on the idea, I put down more resources and blockers. What data sets were helpful during this project? What problems did I run into that will block the execution of the idea? Eventually, the ideas progress to `Done` but sometimes they move back to `Ice Box` to be revisited.


Taking Notes 
---
In the past, I took meticulous notes using Slack in a private team. The support for markdown and channels made it easy for me to separate `#recurse` notes from `#programming` and make use of search and code formatting. It was also a good way also to set reminders and organize links. 

However being on multiple other Slack Teams, it made it too easy to become distracted. To improve my focus I decided to switch off to using Google Docs instead. 

Google Docs allowed me to keep notes and use their outline feature to keep a running collection of all of my notes. I broke down each day into specific sections and started a new section each day.

Using Google Docs, it also made it easy enough to jot down on my phone or on my laptop insights and problems I ran into as they came. It's also a large reason how I'm able to write blog entries post fact by reviewing my notes I wrote on that day. 

Aside from a `Running Notes` doc, I keep a specialized `Journal` doc to keep an easily digestible short summary of what I did each day. 

Maintaining Links
---  
Slack is great because it also allowed me to manage and annotate links. However, with migrating off Slack, I had to look for a better solution to search and maintain links. Google Keep is a wonderful service to maintain and annotate links you stumble upon every day. 

I use Google keep to put together an idea board for saving and reflecting on cool links that other Recursers shared or I happen to come upon on my daily routine. It has been rewarding and decluters the need of syncing bookmarks across browsers and devices.


Managing Time
---
I arrive early at the space and leave late. At the end of the Day, I want to be able to reflect on what I spent my time on and more effectively tackle it the next day. I utilize a time tracking tool called [Harvest](https://harvestapp.com). Traditionally harvest is used to track time to bill clients but it also has a great free tier for users to try out the product for small time users. I use it to manage my time into various categories. 

- `Events`: Event's held in the RC space.
- `Food`: We all have to eat sometimes. Tracking long and short lunches.
- `Programming`: Time I spend executing an idea.
- `Learning`: Time I put that I'm reading documentation or understanding a concept or field.
- `Meetings`: Umbrella category for 1:1s, check-ins or impromptu meetings. 
- `"Project Management"`: A general category I put time to whether its Zulip or checking Email or reading Hacker News
- `Fun`: Examples are wandering Central Park or attending a Conference or Meetup.

In addition to tracking time in Harvest, I keep myself on track by trying to timebox tasks using Pomodoro sessions. It's hard to do meaningful code based work using 25/5 sessions so I changed to 55/5 upon a good recommendation. Although at the aim of the sprints are to finish the task endeavored upon, interruptions happen 

Conclusion
---
Many of these practices evolved during my first week. I abandoned Slack after I easily found myself distracted by different channels when I went to take notes or save links. After I noticed a disparate amount of time I spent sussing out the right idea, I picked ideas from the board and attempted to spend more time Programming. 

I'm always curious to know what techniques help people pick and work on ideas that matter to them and their process. Share below if any of this works for you or specific processed that help you.  I'll probably change up a few of these practices and continue evolving them over time.
