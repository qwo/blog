### Intro

In a [post](2018/aws-solutions-certified) earlier,  I mentioned how I prepared for the Amazon Solutions Architect Associate Exam. This is my path that I will be using to prepare for the professional one.
I recently achieved my Amazon websolutions Professional Certification and received an 83%.

### Resources

- https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws - good overall guide
- CloudGuru - (Week Trial) - Found this course high level overview but not comprehensive for use
- CloudAcademy (Week Trial) - Was the most deep dive, useful information I found on here + their quizes.
- LinuxAcademy (Week Trial) - Found these videos/quiz very useful overall.
- WhizLabs Practices Exams  - Practicer exams very well until you can get 80%+.

## General Tips

Practice all the resources above for content and get use to reading/scanning questions.
The exam I was able to finish and review
Test taking matrix, you get two sheets of paper:
- for each question either answer
- checkmark for definitely right
- line for possible
- X for definitely wrong
