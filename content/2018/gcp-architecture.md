Back in May, I [shared on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6399229464563187713/) that I received my [Google Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect) certification. It was probably my most shared post ever on the platform. A week later, I attained the [Data Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer) certification and at the beginning of July, the [Associate Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer). I staked that I was the first engineer at Cloudreach to get all three. I get a few common questions and I hoped to answer all here:

- What's the big difference between them all?
- How do you recommend preparing for them?
- What's the point of professional certifications?


A fun aside is that all the certifications are hosted on [certified.net](https://certified.net),a blockchain backed cert platform. All of my certifications can be verified respectively below:
