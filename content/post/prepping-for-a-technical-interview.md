Algorithms
- O(time)
- Perform two sortings. O(nLog(n)) QuickSort & Merge Sort maybe familiar yourself with others - Tree Traversals - in, post, pre - order, breadth/level and depth
- tree structures, binary, tri-nary, heap trees, AVL
- Graph problems... Dijkstras, A, common n = np problems. Know Edges and Vertices
- Did i say n = np problems... N = NP Problems.

Notes
- Use quick if you can but doesn't always guarente nlog(n) and can become O(n^2)
- Merge sort is best alternative when no Random Access (Stack, Queue, list) of the stucture
- Heap sort is also in there if quicksort starts degenerates
