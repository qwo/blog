## Raleigh
All Things Open is an amazing conference in its fourth year running hosted in Raleigh North Carolina. It's a conference that celebrates open source and the community behind it. It's two days of amazing learning, networking, and fun times with fellow developers.

## Why you should go
- Cheap Price: for $199 this was a very inexpensive conference. The conference hotel for *one day* cost more than two days of tickets including great after hours celebrations on three days. 
- Celebrates Open Source: the breadth and diversity of open source contributors is amazing. Spending a few days getting to talk to open source contributors and companies let's you know what everyones interested in and where the industry is going.   
- Diversity of Topics: There were 8 different tracks you could mix or match. If you were doing something tech, there was something there for you.

Had a great diversity of talks below. For my ticket I decided to volunteer and supervise a room for 4 hours in exchange for my ticket. I helped monitor the Hardware Track Room 2. Besides some near scares and running around searching for adapters it was a pretty tame time and excellent value.
