## Raleigh
All Things Open is an amazing conference in its fourth year running hosted in Raleigh North Carolina. It's a conference that celebrates open source and the community behind it. Two days of pure learning, networking and fun times with fellow developers.

Early-Registration. Over 2000+ Attendees for two days.

<br/>

## You Should Go
- **Cheap Price:** for $199 this was a very inexpensive conference. The conference hotel for *one day* cost more than two days of tickets including great after hours celebrations on three days.
- **Celebrates Open Source:** the breadth and diversity of open source contributors is amazing. Spending a few days getting to talk to open source contributors and companies let's you know what everyones interested in and where the industry is going.
- **Diversity of Topics:** There were 8 different tracks you could mix or match. If you were interested in tech, there was something there for you.

I ended up going with focus on data science and analysis. My background is mostly in full-stack web so this was a refreshing change of pace. I also got to talk a bunch of companies that are defining how you can create companies around open source projects and meet diverse <developers class=""></developers>

Wednesday

Had a great diversity of talks below. For my ticket I decided to volunteer and supervise a room for 4 hours in exchange for my ticket. I helped monitor the Hardware Track Room 2. Besides some near scares and running around searching for adapters it was a pretty tame time and excellent value.

- Culture Trumps Tools: Matt Micene
- IOT/Hardware Track Room 2
    - Continious Engineering for IoT: Jim Ruehlin
    - Open Source for IoT: Dave Hoover

Thursday

Scott's talk was great and had everyone laughing. The rest of the day I continued doing more talks about data and distributed systems. It was a packed house to listen to Mitchell Hashimoto talk, it was very insighful about the challneges of building and maintaining a secure system. I also enjoyed Alex Meadow's down to earth talk about open source and business intelligence.

- Keynote: Scott Hanselman
- Life in the Trenches with Spark: Ian Pointer
- An End to Boring Data with Visualizations: Heather Shapiro
- Secrets, Certificates, and Identity with Vault: Mitchell Hashimoto
- Building Next Generate Data Warehouses: Alex Meadows
