7:30am

wake up early to check out

8:00

check out of the hotel, leave bags to go get breakfast

8:15
---
Realize many of places in london dont open till 9 for breakfast on saturdays. (why?). Time for plan B.

9:00pm
---
walking towards Buckingham, found an awesome cafe. Very rustic and italian waitresses, 5 minutes away from palace.

9:40
---
arrive on the scene of the palace. Theres not much here besides tourists out numbering everyone. Terrifying.

No shows on saturdays, only 11pm on other days for full changing of the guard

10:10

Natural Science Musuem. Its free, close, and rich with history. England is home of Alan Turning and other great computer scientist. Hoping something great it showing.

Was disappointed that there wasn't more than half an exhibit. I think itll change. THe calculator section was huge though.

10:40

Gift shop, got to make the trip worthwhile

11:00
---
wanted to go to the natural history musuem. Tourist lined out the door that wrapped the block. Sat for 10 minutes counting how long it would take.

By my estimation from the end about 1:30 to get inside

Skip musuem, snap some pics and leave.

12:00pm
---
Last item on checklist fish and chips from somewhere local. Laughing Halibut has been on the list for forever.

1:00pm
---
satisfied fish-n-chips craving, heading to king station return to hotel. Best idea to always leave bags at hotel.

1:30
---
Take taxi cab to Kings Crossing station. Very scenic and much more realistic than trying to ride the metro in.

2pm
---
Sitting in crossing station typing this blog entry.
Woo. Note to travelers, no wifi whatsoever.

2-Three-Quarters:15
---
Saw the 9 3/4 quarters platforms. another line another dizzing amount of tourists.

3:00
---
Take the train to Thornaby, Train from London connects to Thornaby which is south of New Castle which is closer to where Kelly's family lives.

Took the eastern line which is equipped with wifi but pay per day/week for $5/10. The speeds are terrible overall. Used a mac address randomizer to get a new IP and switched every 15 minutes.

5:50

Arrived at the Thornaby station. Fun crazy ride until you arrive and your host is not there and you have no wifi/telphones/addressed.

Glad it worked out in the end ...
