Software intuitive enough without any understanding about the the system.

Icons and userflow that doesn't make the user think. Don't make me think, Luke W.

Intuitive
> using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning; instinctive.

Intuition
> the power or faculty of attaining to direct knowledge or cognition without evident rational thought and inference

- Living 80 year old grandma, using technology at home.
- Phone calls across distances using long distance communication
- Intuitiveness of UI layout to perform actions
