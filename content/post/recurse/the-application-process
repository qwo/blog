Notes from past Recursers and the blog about applying to the program helped me navigate the process and keep my sanity. [John Hergenroeder's](http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/) was especially insightful so I hope this article can do the same. By the way, if you're reading this you should consider [applying to the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat).


Submit an Application

For the initial application, it asks you a few questions and asks you to submit a succinct code gist that doesn't use frameworks or require too much background knowledge to be understood by a reader.

I hadn't had anything on hand, so that saturday I spent the afternoon coding Boggle in Python on the CLI.
I got nervous since I thought maybe it wasn't complex enough or that the browser with the 2.3mb wordlist I sent was too big. I spent saturday morning on the
I think spent the rest of the night on the paper application and exhaustinly submitted the following Sunday night.

[Boggle in ~200 Lines of Code in Python and in the CLI] (https://gist.github.com/stanzheng/d41bd3cada14c3b6310f33f0793e4ec2).

If you get called back, each of the subsequent interviews are scheduled through the Recurse site and take at most ~30 minutes. The interview are conducted over screen sharing and VOIP; We used Skype. You talk to two different admission officers; _Recurse Center_ admission officers who are former recursers themselves. One handles the initial interview, the second handles the code interview.

I felt like we were moving through a million thoughts a minute on the first interview. I left the Interview feeling like I missed out a bunch, but luckily I got the call back.

For the second interview they ask you to build something else ontop of preexisting code you've written or pick one of the suggested problems. I ended up choosing the same gist of code for the sake of time and building scoring. I was super nervous and the night before relinted my code, added unit tests, and changed development workflows so the interview would go smoother. You only get 30 minute and they go by *fast*. Although I had picked scoring, mentally in my head I was thinking of the crazy ways
