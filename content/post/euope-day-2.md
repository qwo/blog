Summary

Couldn't sleep in the hotel, excited to head to the town. Decided to start traveling.

Day 2
====
12am
----
Spent an evening in a Yotel. A yotel is a japanese capsule hotel like suite that offs the basic necesities a travel may need. Rent by the hour.

Getting in at 11PM in Heathrow, this seemed like a happy medium between sleeping on the bench or renting a local four star hotel.[Yotel](hwww.yotel.com/hotels/london-heathrow)

6am

The Heathrow Connector is having technical difficulty. Passengers have to wait for the next one at 6:50pm.

Heathrow Connector is the cheap version of the Heathrow Express. For 50% the price (10vs20GBP) it will get you to Pennlington station. The express is direct and takes a quoted 15 minutes but the connector takes about 30-35min and more prone to break.
