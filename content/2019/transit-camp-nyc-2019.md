I went to Transit Camp NYC 2019 and had a wonderful time! I heard about the event from some mutual friends. I was really into civic tech which I think is a subset of transit planning. It is really exciting to hear about grass root organizing and transit organization meeting together to talk about big ideas. It was interesting the corporate sponsorship of the event. 

I found it exceptionally cool that the whole day was full of unconferences that are were planned day of!

Here are my long form notes from the event.

- The unconference format of open ended discussion wasn't as productive.  Even given good faith discussion there were instanched opinions and agendas that participants bring contensous debate.
- It is organized by the an NYU student transit association and they have done this multiple years.
