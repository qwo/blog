A misconception I held that the US was on Imperial units. The US uses [United States Customary Units (USCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units), which has a common ancestry with  English units but is different than imperial. 

Some fun facts:

* The only three countries in the world that don't use metric are the USA, Liberia, and Myanmar. 
* [NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter](http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/) because a Lockheed Martin engineering team used English units of measurement while the agency's team used the more conventional metric system. 
* The European Union is looking to[ abolish Daylight Savings Time in 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country#Proposals_to_adopt_or_abolish_daylight_saving_time). Its also confusing that the US and the UK observe DST at different times where the US observes it earlier. 

I was encouraged to start thinking ways I could start incorporating more universal units in my life.

* I changed my watch from[ EST to UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) which has made reading server logs much easier! 
* I changed all my weather temperature units from Fahrenheit to Celsius. (I myself doing Celsius x2 + 32 to gauge temperature but less as time goes on)
