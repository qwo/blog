As developers who type source code, use tools and reference documentation, approaching problems on the whiteboard is far removed from what we&rsquo;re used to. I want to focus on some tips that have helped me prepare better for white boarding.</p><p>#Practice the Act of Whiteboarding</p><h2 id=write-it-on-paper>Write it on paper</h2><p>Being someone who types, I have been able to avoid handwriting since high school. However, it has made my handwriting atrophy and even more atrocious. Practicing doing problems on paper is a great way to practice space control equal to doing the problems on the board.</p><h2 id=form-a-group>Form a group</h2><p>Form a group to practice whiteboarding. Each member can give each other a question while the third solves or takes notes. I worked in a 3 person group and for two weeks we gave each other questions with a 25 minute alotment for each question.</p><h2 id=follow-a-format-for-organization>Follow a format for Organization</h2><p>It becomes harder for the interviewer to follow if the board is a mess. It will be easier to follow a set strategy like specific spaces on the board you practice like writing key insights and examples.</p><h1 id=practice-lots-of-problems>Practice lots of problems</h1><p>There are quite a few sites with good practice problems that have automatic tests.
Here is a short list:</p><ul><li><a href=https://leetcode.com>Leetcode</a></li><li><a href=https://hackerrank.com>HackerRank</a></li><li><a href=https://codewars.com>Codewars</a></li></ul><h1 id=be-comfortable-in-the-language-you-re-whiteboarding-in>Be comfortable in the language you&rsquo;re whiteboarding in</h1><p>Picking a language that you are comfortable in is useful. I remember when I first did whiteboarding, I decided to try whiteboarding in C++ when I had mostly been practicing in JavaScript. It ended up becoming very sloppy, mixing syntax between C++ and Java; It&rsquo;s better to whiteboard in a language you&rsquo;re very solid in than one you think the interview would prefer.</p><p>Revisiting a data structures course like <a href=interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>Problem Solving with Python Data Structures</a> was an excellent refresher for me to know the internal tradeoffs in Python. Python is a language I&rsquo;ve been using professionally but not my first language I learned programming with.</p><p>In addition, at minimum would be recommended to know these structures in the language you&rsquo;re familiar with. These recommendations come from the Cracking the Code Interview Sixth Edition.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/26vYoht8pgBOhiRZ9mOLGhr15uMxGgmub33qMToM3boM0M4PV0nFW2tN4JNSlaE6BZ05OxIz8kMAVvnQ2u6l8oBgF-rTrunPzQemCAoTfToqB9fUojM9-0CgxOPPrWStXG8MhP4e72b6xO_mAGw3nLBnxIKqcK76sXNbosExDgFRLh72jgRGfcX3pEbpKYlBoqznJRHkncsE-Ii_W22mTBWny8v_GpRL5LO8Z-GEKRhTLs_TDNlj5lZkFT5eP17Xzo-8mdagqJfHmrJnsqxcp9OWBC4RfMz0CA9Sh9eZLKO6iH1mEtC9rG9JEA3aX_Xot_CfrAuom4geuAd4eg4J2vIKBhvAe0Ojue8svRs9YwClgjU3pNuwJiYFF36F2kfFSXsb465K5hAjXrW8q14Uk-2kd5_26ZeiF16fnLg1YuUVzwj-gtPm3fiYiB1ci6RfaPT3eauXhNC9zAmK6mgV5K6JTHt0SJZgQorPsfBdGan6afphPQAUzCBg97Lh6Mup57XxTmaSeOEcW1lvCzmtxoy7PeVWKdvF-wSGRXHUkH_-EhnXFBv6B8bDpy6TrfxJa8_bGH6qd2yLw68aPuceMv5AyzpnhQrhETLvXSic8f1e58e0p8Z1A8l3qokrtbBN1OA-BdD8Gr5J_NeBSmqEWYh5FFfzWkGr_qMHjpHTieo=w1400-h996-no" alt="From Cracking the Coing Interview"><div class=caption><em>Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition need to knows</em></div></p><h1 id=do-your-homework>Do your homework</h1><p>Research your company to find out their process. If its one of the larger firms, it would be good to practice problems findable on sites like <a href=http://careercup.com/>CareerCup</a> to be prepared. Often recommended is asking recruiters and engineers what the interview process is like directly when finding out about the company.</p><h1 id=repeat>Repeat</h1><p>Doing more of all the above has helped me feel more confident to walk into the office and ace my next whiteboard interview.</p></section></article><footer id=post-meta class=clearfix><a href=https://twitter.com/stanzheng><img class=avatar src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3683993?v=3&s=466"><div><span class=dark>Stanley Zheng</span>
