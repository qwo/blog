Did I accomplish what I set out to do? Did I become a better programmer? How would I describe my experience to others?
I&amp;rsquo;ll be direct and say my experience at Recurse was overly positive and I&amp;rsquo;m still in awe that it exists.</description></item><item><title>RC 11: Stanleybot ðŸ¤– 1.Oh.n0</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/ai-chatbots/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:07:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/ai-chatbots/</guid><description>During my last week at Recurse, I wanted to apply the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained about Machine Learning into a project. During my batch, I spent a portion of my time immersing myself with the terminology, concepts, and tooling but not as much as I hoped building and applying what I&amp;rsquo;d learned.
On the final week, I wanted to attempt one of the projects on my back burner for a while.</description></item><item><title>RC 10: Preparing for the Software Interview</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/interview-prep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 17:18:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/interview-prep/</guid><description>Software interviewing practices in the US usually involve a combination of the below
Phone Screens Team Pairing Take Home Projects Design and Architecture Interviews Whiteboard Interviews Hopefully, I am not alone in the shared dread of whiteboarding. As developers who type source code, use tools and reference documentation, approaching problems on the whiteboard is far removed from what we&amp;rsquo;re used to. I want to focus on some tips that have helped me prepare better for white boarding.</description></item><item><title>RC 9: QDraw - Exploring Google&#39;s Hidden Character API</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/qdraw-hidden-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:43:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/qdraw-hidden-api/</guid><description>QDraw was an RC project I worked on in December in the last week of my batch. I was inspired to build something similar to QuickDraw, a thinkwithgoogle.com project, which allowed you to play Pictionary against the machine. I had been studying machine learning during my batch and thought it was an excellent fun project to try and make. I thought about how I could translate the canvas positions to lines but couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a way to generate enough tag data to make it work.</description></item><item><title>RC 8: Alternative to GSuite: Named domains with Zoho</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/ditching-gsuite/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:43:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/ditching-gsuite/</guid><description>Edit This method isn&amp;rsquo;t possible anymore as email forwarding requires premium to forward email but sending email possible.
To use send from GMAIL from Zoho configure the below settings
Under Gmail -&amp;gt; Settings, Click &amp;ldquo;add a mail account&amp;rdquo; Select the email provider with smtp.zoho.com over port 465 using your confirmed email. This will use SSL over email. If you use SSO using another provider, you will have to generate a one time password to use from https://accounts.</description></item><item><title>RC 7: Chrome Productivity Extensions</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/7-code-productivity-chrome-exts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 19:54:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/7-code-productivity-chrome-exts/</guid><description>Extensions are an excellent way to augment a browser user experience to be more useful for the user. However, extensions can also make your browser less performant and even open security issues for your browser. When I install any Chrome Extension I look at their requested permissions and better yet source to make sure they are sensible. Most of these extensions are catered towards software developers and are very practical and familiar for approaching the web.</description></item><item><title>RC 6: Quantified Checkin</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/halfway-checkin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 15:55:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/halfway-checkin/</guid><description>My time at the Recurse Center is halfway over, and the next portion starts this Tuesday on Jan 3rd in the new year after a week hiatus. There will be ~30 new faces joining and only 6 weeks left of the batch left. Two months have flown by and so much has been done it&amp;rsquo;s hard to gather and describe so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to quantify it integers and data form.</description></item><item><title>RC 5: Code &amp;&amp; People</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/more-to-rc-than-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 15:00:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/more-to-rc-than-code/</guid><description>Software is more than code, its includes the people and communities that form around them. Code and humans are irrevocably inseparable (for now&amp;hellip;) and while at the Recurse Center we are focused on writing code, building projects, and exploring new concepts it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ignore the people and the human elements in the mix.
Often when I&amp;rsquo;m asked to describe the Recurse Center, I tend to talk more about the people and ideas being shared instead of the physical space or even projects we work on.</description></item><item><title>RC 4: Debugging debugging</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/debugging-debugging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 22:13:50 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/debugging-debugging/</guid><description>Debugging is easy, the answer is always the the last place you look. Mastery of debugging I would argue is a more valuable skill than programming itself. Often the worst feelings are staring at your code hopelessly trying to understand where the logic is breaking down.
At Recurse, there are lots of ways to tap into help. We have Zulip stream&amp;rsquo;s dedicated to every programming language imaginable, #pairing, #advice, and even just plain #help.</description></item><item><title>RC 3: Applying to the Recurse Center</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/the-application-process/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 16:50:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/the-application-process/</guid><description>Notes from past Recursers on applying to recurse helped me navigate the process and keep my sanity. John Hergenroeder&amp;rsquo;s was especially insightful so I hope this can do the same and add another data point.
High-level timeline This is my timeline, I wanted to join Winter 1 which started in November so I made sure to follow up as fast as possible.

Settling In Each week I hope to go deeper and highlight something I&amp;rsquo;m working on at Recurse. Coming into Recurse I aimed to get into a routine and continue it throughout the twelve weeks. I read the community wikipedia and all the accounts I could find online about how I could make the most out of my time at the center.</description></item><item><title>RC 1: Orientation</title><link>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/day-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 14:45:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://stanleyzhengnyc.github.io/blog/recurse/day-1/</guid><description>Note: The title was renamed to RC:1 from Day1 to better reflect these entries as a series but not by week
Day one of RC is widely different from every other day. Its more structured and is full of presentations and socializing. This is my personal account from my day one experience, your experience may vary. They are always changing and aiming to improve the first day experience.
Getting to NYC I took the bus up from Norfolk, Virginia to New York Saturday night.</description></item></channel></rss>
