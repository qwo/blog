A state of emergency was declared by the president for covid-19. This was also precipice by the state and the City of New York doing the same.</p><p>My first question is, OK, we&rsquo;re in a state of emergency but when does this happen and when does it happen. According to some quick googling, the president has usually X number of powers where congressional approval is required. Of these X powers, #Y of them can be granted to the president without approval under a state of emergency.</p><p>Looking at this in a historical context, I found the Wikipedia page and discussed it with a group of friends.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States</a></p><p>I uploaded it to a spreadsheet for quick facts</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wF1vTxZkc6HK48CiMvsK9WX3e4pXH6LR1__M-vF9pzg/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wF1vTxZkc6HK48CiMvsK9WX3e4pXH6LR1__M-vF9pzg/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wF1vTxZkc6HK48CiMvsK9WX3e4pXH6LR1__M-vF9pzg/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>QF</p><ul><li>Been 68 different National States Of Emergencies,</li><li>34 have ended, 34 are still ongoing</li><li>Different Types include<ul><li>Arms</li><li>Economic</li><li>Legal</li><li>Maritime</li><li>Military</li><li>Public health</li><li>Sanctions</li><li>Trade</li></ul></li><li>Clinton Declared the most at # 16</li><li>The most common type declared are economic sanctions</li></ul><p>To note</p><ul><li>Some national emergencies start and end, but some are on going</li><li>There are different flavors, IE National Health / Military / Economic ones are subtle.</li><li>A crisis maybe inherited into the ongoing president as the same as an outgoing president the crisis is not over.</li></ul><p>There have been 3 Public Health Nation Crisis declared by the US</p><ol><li>Under Obama October 24, 2009 for H1N1</li><li>Under Trump, March 13, 2020 for covid-19</li></ol><p>The first one ever declared was under Wilson February 5, 1917 which establish the US Navy &ldquo;Maritime Emergency in Water Transportation of the United States (Proclamation 1354)&rdquo;</p><p>The second one ever was under Franklin Roosevelt in March 9, 1933 largely to curve the great depression</p><p>The following ones under Truman were in anticipation and response to World War II.
