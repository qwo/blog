On Friday March 13th, I had just gotten out of a doctors appoint when my phone was abuzz. A state of emergency was declared by the president for covid-19. This was also precipiced by the state and the City of New York doing the same.

My first question is, OK, we're in a state of emergency but when does this happen and when does it happen. According to some quick googling, the president has usually X number of powers where congressional approval is required. Of these X powers, #Y of them can be granted to the president without approval under a state of emergency.

Looking at this in a historical context, I found the Wikipedia page and discussed it with a group of friends.
