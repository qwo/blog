I saw that  chinatown nyc, a businesses development community group was  sharing posting restaurant last week that were open during the crisis. They unfortunately were doing JPGs with spreadsheets which are unfortunately difficult to read and parse.

I took the effort to make it into an airtable and shared the 4 people behind the org how to maintain it long term. This has helped because it has allowed other people to build apps on top of the data. if you want to help maintain to build apps on top of the data let me know
